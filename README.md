## Electron Distribution in Atoms - React Chemistry Learning Tool

### Description

This project is a static React application designed to help high school chemistry students grasp the fundamentals of electron distribution within atoms. It provides an interactive and visual approach to understanding electron configurations and their impact on an atom's properties.

### Learning Objectives

* Understand electron subshells and their designations (s, p, d, f).
* Learn how electrons are distributed across subshells according to the Aufbau principle and the Pauli exclusion principle.

### Tech Stack

* ReactJS
* Jest

### Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager)

   - Verify installation with `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
   - Download from [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en) if not present.

**Clone the Repository:**

``` git clone git@github.com:felipeeu/orbitals.git  ```

**Install Dependencies:**

1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd orbitals`
2. Run: `npm install`

### Running the Application

1. Start the development server: `npm start`
   - This typically opens the application in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### Testing

Run unit tests: `npm test`

### Usage

* Interactive visualization of atomic subshells and electron quantities.
* Exploration of electron placement and resulting electron configurations.


### Customization

Adapt the project to fit your teaching style and students' needs:

* Modify React components, content, and visuals to align with your curriculum.
